# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the basic setup for a personal portfolio website. It uses a simple static-site workflow that can be served locally with `lite-server`.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  index.html        # main page
  css/style.css     # styles
  js/main.js        # JavaScript logic
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   (This installs `lite-server`, which provides a local development server.)

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Then open your browser at the address printed in the console (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

Feel free to customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files under `src/` to build out your portfolio.
